    <h3>Zyzz Quotes</h3>
    <p>"I don't workout for chicks, I workout to create an aura, when I walk into a room,
        introduce myself to someone, go for a job interview, I love looking dominant, in
        charge, and in control. I love walking past and having people point and talk about
        me, I love the fact that when I go somewhere with thousands of people, almost all
        of them will remember who I am when it is over, and I didn't even have to say
        a word."</p>

    <p>"Everybody, one day, will die and be forgotten.
        Act and behave in a way that will make life interesting and fun, fuck a mundane, predictable life working Monday
        to Friday with something you derive no pleasure from just living life out till you grow old and wither away.
        Find a passion, form relationships, don't be afraid to get out there and fuck what everyone else thinks, trust
        me it's a lot more fun that way."</p>
