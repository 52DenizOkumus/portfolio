        <p> Before becoming a bodybuilder, Shavershian had been described as a "skinny kid" and an ectomorph.
            Once he completed secondary school, inspired by his bodybuilder brother, he joined a local gym and began
            learning
            about nutrition and training, applying it to his pursuit of becoming a bodybuilder.
            He would spend three to four hours a day training in the gym.
            His favourite professional bodybuilders included Arnold Schwarzenegger and Frank Zane.</p>

        <h3>Zyzz Quotes</h3>
        <p>"I don't workout for chicks, I workout to create an aura, when I walk into a room,
            introduce myself to someone, go for a job interview, I love looking dominant, in
            charge, and in control. I love walking past and having people point and talk about
            me, I love the fact that when I go somewhere with thousands of people, almost all
            of them will remember who I am when it is over, and I didn't even have to say
            a word."</p>
        &nbsp;

        &nbsp;
        <p>"Everybody, one day, will die and be forgotten.
            Act and behave in a way that will make life interesting and fun, fuck a mundane, predictable life working Monday
            to Friday with something you derive no pleasure from just living life out till you grow old and wither away.
            Find a passion, form relationships, don't be afraid to get out there and fuck what everyone else thinks, trust
            me it's a lot more fun that way."</p>
